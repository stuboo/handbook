`.jrs-edu-asnm`

### Sacral Nerve Stimulator Post-Operative Care
You play an important role in your own recovery. You will be given a daily diary to document the effectiveness of the implant. After each surgery you will have post-op follow-up as listed below:

Stage 1 (temporary lead placement): After discharge from the hospital a team member will be in contact with you every 1-2 days to assess the effectiveness of the device.
Stage 2 (permanent implant placement): After your second surgery we will see you for a post-op appointment 2 weeks after the procedure.

### Caring for Your Wound

* After surgery you will have a dressing over the surgical site.

#### Stage 1

* **Do not remove or change the dressing. If your dressing becomes saturated or loose, you may reinforce it with more tape and/or gauze, but you should call the office to be evaluated.**
* No showers after a stage 1 surgery.

#### Stage 2

* Your dressing can be removed on the day of surgery and **you may shower thereafter**.

### Post Surgical Pain
• It is normal to experience some discomfort post operatively. The stimulation _should not_ be painful.

### Stimulation

* Stimulation is the _pulling_ or _tingling_ sensation felt in the pelvic area (near the vagina or anal area.) It _should not_ be painful. If it is painful or you feel the stimulation sensation move down the legs decrease the stimulation and call the office and speak to a nurse.
* During the trial period (stage 1) you may notice that the device has improved your continence which means it is working and on the correct setting. If you are having episodes of incontinence you will need to increase your device setting by moving the dial up slowly.

### Activity

* Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 14 days after your surgery.
* Avoid deep bending or heavy squatting for 6 weeks after your surgery.

### Symptoms to Report
• Severe or worsening pain, unrelieved by pain medications.
• Fever, greater than 100.5ºF, chills or sweats
• Painful or problems urinating
• Any problems with the device
