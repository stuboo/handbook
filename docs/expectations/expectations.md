# Expectations

Above all else, I expect you to be kind and engaged.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The expectations below are divided into three categories: [clinical](#clinical), [educational](#educational), and [professional](#professional). It is my job to make sure that the clinical and educational sections overlap as much as possible and I will strive to make the balance of this rotation lean more toward education than to service. If you feel that I am not meeting this goal, please let me know - without worry of judgement or retribution.

## Educational ##
The following urogynecology-relevant items are taken directly from the [CREOG Learning Objectives, 12th Edition](https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/files/creog/creog-educational-objectives-12th-edition-secured.pdf). **I encourage you to read this entire document a couple of times per year to remind yourself of the depth and breadth of information there is to learn across all specialties (and to focus your reading/studying).**

- List risk factors of, diagnose, and perform initial management of the following obstetric complications:
	- Obstetric Laceration
	- Perineal hematoma
- Counsel about the normal healing process of obstetric lacerations and episiotomy.
- Screen for urinary and fecal incontinence in the postpartum period. (If you're looking for a resident research and/or quality project, this is one.)
- Diagnose and perform initial management of postpartum complications, including the following:
	- Infections (UTI)
	- Urinary tract injury
	- Laceration/episiotomy breakdown
- For the following presenting conditions, perform pertinent history and evaluation, including diagnostic procedures, consult subspecialists when appropriate, counsel, and manage medically and surgically:
	- Pelvic pain (acute or chronic) - for urogyn this will focus on musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and genitourinary
	- Urinary tract infection
	- Pelvic organ prolapse
	- Urinary incontinence
	- Fecal incontinence
- Provide lifestyle and life-phase counseling, such as reproductive health or menopause counseling.
- Perimenopause and Menopause
	- Understand the definition, physiology, and description
	- Counsel and advise patients about perimenopause and natural and induced menopause
	- Manage patients with perimenopause and menopause
		- Counsel and advise patients about nutritional and behavioral interventions
		- Counsel and advise patients about medical and pharmacologic interventions, including hormone therapy.
		- Counsel patients about the benefits and risks of medical interventions.
- Geriatric Care
	- Diagnose and manage pelvic floor support and incontinence disorders.

## Clinical ##

### In the Office
- Review charts prior to the office day and pick HALF of the new patients that you want to see
	- This is a pilot program - we'll see how it changes with time
- Read about the conditions you expect to encounter in these patients.
- Review the new patient paperwork, new data (PVR, uroflow), and take the patient's history
- We'll do exams together.
	- I'll probably do them the first half of your rotation and you will do the second half.
- Do your best to develop a plan.

### Preoperatively

- Read about the patient and know her history.
	- How did she present? How did we make the diagnosis?
	- What other medical/surgical options did/does she have?
	- Why did we choose this procedure?
	- What postop considerations are unique to this patient?
- Read about the procedure(s) we plan to perform.
	- REVIEW. THE. ANATOMY.
	- Know the basic steps of the operation.
	- Make incision plans.
	- What are the major risks of the procedure?
	- What risks may be elevated in this patient?
	- How would you describe the success rate for this procedure(s)?
	- What can the patient expect postoperatively?
- Complete the Preop H&P when appropriate.
- Review the consent form to be sure it matches the patient, her history, and the office notes.
- Consider preoperative antibiotic and DVT prophylaxis and order accordingly.

### Intraoperatively

- Review equipment and instruments that will be used. Ensure that the proper items are available.
- Position lights and screens appropriately for the planned case.
- Position the patient. Know the most common injuries, their presentations, and treatment.
- Teach (and remind me to teach) the medical students the basics of [uro]gyn surgery.
- Ask for guidance if you are uncertain of your role. You will almost always be the first assistant.

### Postoperatively

- Admission and/or discharge orders
- Discharge medications to pharmacy
- Discharge summaries when appropriate
- Patient education materials for pain control, catheter management, and precautions
- Communicate with nursing to optimize timely delivery of care
- Manage the voiding trial when applicable
- Follow up on ANY pathology for any patient on whom you operated or assisted (this does not mean you have to notify or discuss with the patient)
