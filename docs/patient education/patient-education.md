# Patient Education

The overwhelming majority of patient education materials that I provide in the office will come from AUGS and IUGA. Patient education packets can be made using [this tool](https://combine-hn09br920-jryanstewart.vercel.app/) that allows for easy search and selection of patient education materials based on diagnosis and symptoms.

There are, however, custom documents that we will use postoperatively so that postop counseling matches preop counseling. This list will grow with time. Use the dot-phrases in the right hand column to save yourself time postop.
