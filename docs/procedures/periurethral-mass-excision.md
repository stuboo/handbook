## Operative Note

Each of these cases is unique enough that there is no standard operative note. A large part of the case will, however, certainly be protection of the urethra. The female urethra is an average of 24fr. Using a large catheter (18-22fr) is a good way of doing this. Adequate exposure and hemostasis are also critically important.

## Postoperative Considerations

|**Follow Up**|6 Weeks|
|**Voiding Requirements**|SEE BELOW|
|**Opioids**|AS NEEDED: Oxycodone 5mg PO Q6H #6|
|**Pain Control**|SCHEDULED: 1g acetaminophen and 600mg ibuprofen Q6H x 4 days, ALTERNATE |
|**Precautions**|Urinary tract infection, Urinary retention, Bleeding|
|**Restrictions**|Pelvic Rest x 6 weeks, Resume other activity slowly and as tolerated|

If the uretha is opened during the case, the foley catheter (or a suprapubic catheter) will stay in place for about 10 days. If the urethra was not compromised, then a passive voiding trail in the recover room is appropriate (PVR should be < 150mL>).
