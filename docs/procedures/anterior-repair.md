# Anterior Repair
{: .no_toc }

This segment is brief because isolated anterior vaginal defects are quite uncommon and [anterior vaginal wall defects that are surgically repaired usually require a concomitant repair of the apex](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17132485/).

## Operative Note

A 4cm midline vertical incision was created in the midline of the anterior vagina. The vaginal epithelium was dissected away from the underlying endopelvic connective tissue laterally to the pubic rami. the defect was then plicated with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Vicryl. Excess vaginal epithelium was then trimmed and the vaginal incision was closed with 2-0 Vicryl. Cystoscopy was performed to evaluate ureteral patency. Brisk bilateral jets were noted.
