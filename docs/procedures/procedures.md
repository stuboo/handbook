# Procedures
{: .no_toc }

The procedures listed in this section are the "bread and butter" of urogynecology. We often mix-and-match these procedures to build a reconstruction plan for patients' based on their anatomy, goals, and surgical history. As such, reviewing/preparing for a case may involve reviews of multiple procedures ad consideration of the _order of operations_.
