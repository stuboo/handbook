# Assets
{: .no_toc }

The sections below are simply a respository where I link to articles, books, videos, and other links that _I think_ will help to enhance your learning. If you find resources that you would like me to share with your colleagues, please send them to me and I will add them ASAP.

## Anki Decks

I'm slowly amassing a collection of Anki decks related to urogynecology. The decks will be built at the "fellow" learning level. Later, I will add a "resident" tag to those cards that I think are high yield and/or important for residents. For now, if you're choosing from the decks below, start with the anatomy deck.
