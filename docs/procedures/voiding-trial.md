## Active Voiding Trial
### Supplies
* 10 mL syringe
* 60 mL catheter-tipped syringe (Tumi irrigation syringe)
* Nonsterile gloves
* 300 mL of sterile saline
* Commode-mounted urine measurement container (potty hat)
* Clamp

### Steps
1. Confirm that all urine is drained from the bladder with the indwelling Foley catheter in place
2. Insert 300mL bolus of saline through syringe and into the bladder through the indwelling catheter
3. Clamp the catheter 
4. Deflate the balloon and remove the catheter
5. The patient should void within 30 minutes of catheter remvoal
6. Record voided volume

### Interpretation
* Postvoid residual (PVR) is indirectly determined by subtracting the voided volume from the 300 mL of instilled fluid

Example: 
{: .text-delta}
* 300 mL instilled
* Patient voids 220 mL
* 300 mL instilled â€“ 220 mL voided = 80 mL PVR
* **If PVR < 150mL, the patient passes the voiding trial.**

## Passive Voiding Trial

* Remove foley catheter
* Allow the patient's bladder to fill spontaneously (up to 4 hours)
* Patient should notify nurse when she feels the urge to void
* Post void residual should be measured by ultrasound (bladder scan) or I/O cath within 10 minutes of voiding
* **If PVR < 150mL, the patient passes the voiding trial.**
